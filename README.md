This Python code uses machine learning techniques, in particular the Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm, to perform sentiment analysis on tweets. The goal is to determine the sentiment expressed in tweets.

The are two nbooks with similar code but applied on different data. 

requirements.txt --> libraries for both nbooks

nbook_0.ipynb --> notebook Jupyter for the twitter_samples (small dataset)
main_code_0.py --> Python's code of nbook_0.ipynb (twitter_samples only)

Folder 'Input' --> contains (kaggle's data = twitter_training.csv & twitter_validation.csv)
nbook_1.ipynb --> Python's code for the kaggle's data (large dataset)
